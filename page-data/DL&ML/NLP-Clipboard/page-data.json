He once served right next to the King, took different kinds of positions such as Secret Royal Inspector. He was also an engineer who contributed to build Suwon Hwaseong Fortress. Nevertheless, after being defeated in political power game, he have been overthrown from his government office.</p>\n<p>But this is not the reason that I spent time knowing about him. After being overthrown from the government office, he was sent to remote countryside to spend more than 18 years. For those lonely 18 years, he begins his second chapter of his lifetime. It is known that he have written more than 1000 books in his exile.</p>\n<p><strong>What were the methods that enabled him to study such diverse fields?</strong> I was certain that parents like Jeong must have written lengthy instruction for his children's education. So I digged in the collection of letters to Jeong's two sons that were sent during the exile.</p>\n<p>I found that Jeong collected excerpts from the other books, knitted those sentences to write a book of his own. This was common practical method that any other researchers(or undergraduates) do in order to write a thesis these days. The method itself was nothing special. What was important was to collect as many sources as possible, collect useful information from those sources.</p>\n<p><strong>I believe creating clipboard of excerpts is the starting point for learning, regardless of fields of study.</strong> Even if the table of contents are identitcal, each NLP researchers has their own emphasis in their books. Explaining the same concept, some researchers use Pytorch code to show the underlying structure whereas some uses visualized diagrams.</p>\n<p>For being greedy person who wants to learn as broadly and as deeply as possible, this clipboard will collect sentences that helped me out in understanding certain concepts. If materials are collected enough to write separate post of its own, it will be taken off from this clipboard.</p>\n<p><strong>In short, I believe collecting fragments of knowledge from different kinds of sources completes multifaceted understanding.</strong> Currently I am collecting clipboards at the team repository!</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/DL&#x26;ML/NLP-Clipboard/#why-i-collect-sentences-from-the-other-books\">Why I collect sentences from the other books</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-09-07","title":"NLP Clipboard","tags":["NLP"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/DL&ML/NLP-Clipboard/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/DL&ML/Mask-Age-Gender-Classification-Competition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Classification Competition Wrap up report 1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/DL&ML/Dacon-Stock-Price-Competition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using ElasticNetCV for Stock Price Prediction"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1081905842","3911196313"]}
