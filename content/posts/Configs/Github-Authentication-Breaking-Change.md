Breaking change has affected Github users like me from today and on. Users who are working on remote, such as pushing to remote repo, [via Command line interface or 3rd party app will have to go through authentication process](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/) for security purpose. Github Desktop Application users remain unaffected by this change.

Solution was pretty simple which was [caching Github Credentials on the local device following the instruction of the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git).
