### Leaderboard Shake-up

There was huge shake-ups on the leaderboard. 
- public 1st â†’ private 6th
- *public 2nd â†’ private 2nd (ðŸ¤š Our team)*
- public 3rd  â†’ private 12th
- public 4th â†’ private 1st
- public 5th â†’ private 3rd

Shake-up was due to China Evergrande debt crisis affecting Korean stock market. 
- The public leaderboard week of `09-15 ~ 09-24` was prior to the Evergrande debt crisis. 
- The private leaderboard week of `09-27 ~ 10-01` was just after Evergrande issue was disclosed.

Our team maintained the second place for both public and private leaderboard. **Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that our ElasticNetCV model isnâ€™t overfitted to particular week.**

### Performance

**Our ElasticNetCV modelâ€™s NMAE score outperformed Baselineâ€™s score by  30%.** 

|       Model       | NMAE (09-06 ~ 09-10) | NMAE (09-27 ~ 10-01) |
| :---------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|  **ElasticNetCV** |              **3.02**              |              **4.44**              |
| Linear Regression (Baseline) |              4.03              |               6.42               |

The submission is the result of ElasticNetCV model only. This was to assess the single modelâ€™s performance compared to other possibly ensembled submissions. Thus, we can possibly conclude that ElaticNetCV may reduce the errors of the prediction when ensembled with other model.
